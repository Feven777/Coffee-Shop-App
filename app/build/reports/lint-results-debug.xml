        severity="Warning"
        message="Launcher icon used as round icon did not have a circular shape"
        category="Usability:Icons"
        priority="6"
        summary="The launcher icon shape should use a distinct silhouette"
        explanation="According to the Android Design Guide (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your launcher icons should &quot;use a distinct silhouette&quot;, a &quot;three-dimensional, front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth.&quot;&#xA;&#xA;The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled square.">
